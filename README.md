# portfolio-website
This is a portfolio website, currently a WIP.

Edit: I kinda went off the rail when learning basic HTML and CSS. So index.html is current non-existent, and I am making a simple static website to buy tanks. The proper portfolio site will appear soon, using Tailwind CSS. So enjoy me devolving into monke.
